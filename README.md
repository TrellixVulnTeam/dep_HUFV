# dep

A little Node.js dependency installer with the bare minimum features for module **end-users**.

###### Roadmap to v1.0.0
+ Stand alone installer
+ Follow the spec of npm's [package-lock.json]
+ `install <pkg> [--save|--save-dev|--global]`

## Features
+ **Install** the dependencies defined in a local package.json.
+ **Lock** the dependencies installed in a local node_modules.
+ **Run** an arbitrary command from scripts in a local package.json.

dep is trying to have a similar/same interface of the features with npm, but there are some slightly different implementations internally.

### Right permission
To avoid from the risks related the lifecycle install scripts of the package while installing, dep doesn't allow you to run them if you are running `dep install` as a root user.

### Save spaces
Speed and local disk capacity are a trade-off. To take the both benefits, it would be better to have the cache in somewhere proxy layer instead of local.

Therefore, dep does not make cache files in a local disc for now.

### Stability
Stability is a core value. Having a small set makes keeping the green badges easier.

### dep â™¥ [dat]
This feature is **experimental**.

You can provide a [dat] link as a dependency source.
A dat link is like an `http:// link`, but with special properties.

Here is an example package.json with a dat called [emoji-cli]. It just contains the package data as like its [git repository].
```json
{
  "name": "an-app",
  "description": "an example app",
  "dependencies": {
    "emoji-cli": "dat://7fdbb7b4ea8be0e5d9c1469aa4056377a092d8787b6e3452faf0ce8390098d02"
  }
}
```

## Usage
```console
$ dep -h
A little Node.js dependency installer

```

## Bug report
When you find issues, please report them:
+ https://github.com/watilde/dep/issues/new

Be sure to follow the issue template.


## Feature request
We're trying to find out the bare minimum features for end users. That means it is very reluctant to add new features, but having a discussion is useful for clarifying the minimum definitions.

Feel free to ask us in #dep-js on https://package.community/ or on [twitter].
